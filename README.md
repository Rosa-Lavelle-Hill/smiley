The data for this seminar is downloaded from here: https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100268/information/. It contains information on the speed of cars approaching and exiting smiley traffic signs.

The raw data only contains locations in Basel from March-June 2023, in Cycle 1, when the smiley signs were in operation.
